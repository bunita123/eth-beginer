Title - myToken

This Solidity program defines a smart contract named myToken. This smart contract is likely used to create and manage a basic token on a blockchain network and provides the core functionalities of minting and burning tokens.

Description -

if we imagine the code to be deployed on a blockchain network by defining the public variables of the token's identity as GIFT for tokenName, GFT tokenabbrv and  a totalsupply initially set to zero. 
The balances mapping acts as a ledger, meticulously tracking the number of tokens each address holds. 
The mint function serves as the engine for creating new tokens. It takes an address and a value, increasing the overall token supply and crediting the recipient address with the minted amount. This empowers authorized entities (depending on the deployment setup) to issue new tokens. 
Conversely, the burn function allows users to remove tokens from circulation. It takes an address and a value, but incorporates a crucial safety check: it verifies if the sender has enough tokens to burn before proceeding. If the condition is met, the total supply and the sender's balance are both reduced by the specified value.
But there's also something that we should keep in mind that it is a foundational implementation  and for real-world applications, additional features like transferring tokens between addresses, approving allowances for spending tokens on behalf of others, and robust security measures would be necessary.

Executing program-

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at
"https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.js"

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. And make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile eth beginner.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, we can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. And select the "eth beginner" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, we can interact with it by calling the saymyToken function. Click on the "myToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "saymyToken" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and copy the link from the account to the mint address to get a totalsupply value ,
next copy the same link from the account to the burn address to delete or remove any value from the mint value if the value is enough.

We can also put the link from the accout to the balances to see the balance of the mint or burn value.
